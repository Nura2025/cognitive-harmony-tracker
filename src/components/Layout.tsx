I don't have the original content of `src/components/Layout.tsx` in the information you provided, so I can't generate the full code with the pixel theme removed. The AI mentioned that this file was read-only and couldn't be directly modified, but didn't show its contents.

To properly help you, I would need to see the original content of `src/components/Layout.tsx`. Without that, I can't replace the placeholder comments with the actual code while removing the pixel theme elements.

If you can provide the original content of this file, I'll be able to generate the complete code with the pixel theme removed.
